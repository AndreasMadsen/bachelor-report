_By: Andreas Madsen_

## Compile LaTeX report

cd report
make
open Thesis.pdf
```

## Code

The code uses to generate the results is available here:

## License

While the LaTeX code is available it is not open source. That means you are not
allowed to redistribute the PDF, the LaTeX code or any other file. But you can
redistribute this url: https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/bachelor-report

Also I would prefer if you downloaded the my thesis from DTUs (my university)
website: http://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/275433416 - However not everyone can
do that thus the compiled PDF is also available here.
