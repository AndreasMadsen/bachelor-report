\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my superviser Ole Winther for his guidance and support and his Ph.d. student Søren Sønderby for answering questions related to the Sutskever model \cite[p.~1]{sutskever} and Theano \cite{theano-a, theano-b}. I would also like to thank Stephan Gouws who presented the word2vec framework \cite{word2vec-comparing, word2vec-details} at KU, which initially inspired me to do this thesis. Also thanks to Alex Graves for writing an excellent book on Recurrent Neural Network \cite{alexgraves}, I'm quite sure I wouldn't have understood the subject as well as I do now without it.
